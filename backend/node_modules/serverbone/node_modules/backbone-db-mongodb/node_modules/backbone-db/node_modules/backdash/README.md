backdash
========

A fork of [backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) designed for use with lodash and browserify.


## Install

```javascript
npm install backdash
```


## Key Differences

**backbone.js**

[Line 20](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/1.1.2/backbone.js#L20) changed from:

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
```

to:

```javascript
var _ = require('lodash');
```

**package.json**

[Line 8](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/master/package.json#L8) changed from:

```javascript
"underscore"  : ">=1.5.0"
```

to:

```javascript
"lodash": "2.4.1"
```


## Versions

This version of backdash is based on Backbone 1.1.2 and Lodash 2.4.1

Use those versions explicitly in any other module that will build into the target project. Multiple versions of lodash in the dependency tree will cause multiple versions to appear in the built browserify bundle.

Also, it is helpful to run `npm dedupe` after adding modules to the project in order to optimize files within `node_modules` and, consequently, during dependency resolution at build.


## Usage

First, install lodash and backdash:

```javascript
npm install lodash
npm install backdash
```

Then, in each `model`/`collection`/`view`/`router`, use exactly like [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)

```
var _ = require('lodash');
var B = require('backdash');

var ContentView = B.View.extend({
...
});
```

## Use with a DOM Library

As before, lodash and jQuery (or an api-compatible library such as Zepto) must exist on the `window` (or, as called in backbone source, `root`). When building with browserify, the easiest solution is to either:

- If loading jQuery from a CDN, explicitly set `B.$ = global.$;` immediately after the first `require('backdash')` (likely in the [entry file](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#baddfile) used to build the project)
- `require('jquery')` before you first `require('backdash')`
